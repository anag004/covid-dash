# COVID-dashboard

This is a dashboard for our SIRD covid model. The Python code for the projections is located in [this repository](https://github.com/anag004/covid-model). The dashboard is live [here](https://anag004.github.io/covid-dash/). If you notice any bugs file an issue or better yet, open a pull request. If you want to contribute, check out this [guide]() for areas where we need help.
